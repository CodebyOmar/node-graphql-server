# node-graphql-server
Makes it easier for you to build a modularized graphql server using [ExpressJS+MongoDB+GraphQL]. Are you new to GraphQL?, or need to start up a GraphQL server in no time for a hackathon or such ? Clone!

# Usage
Run `npm install` (Removing the node modules in my next push)

you need a mongodb database, create one and change the DB url in the config file.

once your db is setup run `node index.js` from your terminal, visit http://localhost:8080/graphiql and run your mutations and queries from the graphql playground!

Don't forget to star the repo! Enjoy!
